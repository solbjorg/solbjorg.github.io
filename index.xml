I read 57 books last year, and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say I enjoyed most of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My average rating was 3.73 (on a scale from 0.5 to 5). This can mean roughly two things: either I&amp;rsquo;m decently good at choosing books I&amp;rsquo;d like, or I&amp;rsquo;m not that picky; I&amp;rsquo;d like to think it&amp;rsquo;s the former. This is of course also skewed by the fact that if I don&amp;rsquo;t like a book I&amp;rsquo;ll just stop reading it and won&amp;rsquo;t log it as &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I exist!</title><link>https://rikkesolbjorg.no/i-exist/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:49:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://rikkesolbjorg.no/i-exist/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here we are! I should have made this website ages ago, but better late than never. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is generated using Hugo, with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog"&gt;Hugo Bear Blog theme&lt;/a&gt; theme. For now this is just hosted on GitHub Pages, but I would like to move it elsewhere sooner rather than later in hopes of having control of as much of my own web presence as possible. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll finally set up that homelab&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
