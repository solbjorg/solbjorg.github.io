# Hi! Welcome! 

### About

I'm Rikke Solbjørg. This page exists mostly as a new place for me to put things I find interesting, whatever that may be: I like reading, movies, music, programming, games (board or video), to name a few things. I made it because I needed to write things and I needed somewhere to put them; if you want to read them, too, that's great!

My dayjob is in software development: I've worked on embedded Linux, Qt, web, games, digital design and verification, DevOps and CI/CD, and more. I'm lucky to work on things I find interesting.

### LLM Disclaimer

I write because I like writing. I do not use LLMs to write for me: any em-dashes on my site are em-dashes By Humans For Humans™.

### Contact

I try to avoid social media. If you want to contact me, you can instead reach me at rikke.solbjorg \[AT\] gmail \[DOT\] com.
