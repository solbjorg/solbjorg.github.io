# Hi! Welcome! 

I'm Rikke Solbjørg. This page exists mostly as a new place for me to put things I find interesting, whatever that may be; I like reading, movies, music, programming, games (board or video), to name a few things.

My dayjob is in software development: I've worked on embedded Linux, Qt, web, games, digital design and verification, DevOps and CI/CD, and more. I'm lucky enough to work on things I find interesting!

I try to avoid social media. If you want to contact me, you can instead reach me at rikke.solbjorg at gmail dot com.
